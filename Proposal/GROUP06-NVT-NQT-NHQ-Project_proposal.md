## Project Proposal

### 1. Background

In the recent decade, many people are well-apdapted to scheduling with technology, using their tablet or phone; especially, in universities, student and university interractions are available online. However, the amount of apps and links are exclusively abundant, including alarms, google calendar, google sheets, notes, etc. . In some cases, students tend to miss or arrive to a lecture without knowing that it had been rescheduled or canceled. 

Therefore, the all-in-one student app will take care of the space and the amount of time needed to find sourses. Student Utils will help students get to class on time, while reminding them of deadlines waiting to be finished.

### 2. Project Scope

For university students, note-taking and scheduling can be a handful task to do everyday. Students tend to memorize or write down on to paper, and usually forget the assigned task or attending lectures. The app will not only help students in their studies but also develop a well-organized life-style.

For working people, reminders and scheduling have been an arguably problem. People still persist to using multiple apps to navigate through work. This app could minimize the time to open and switching of the traditional apps.

We define 4 end-points to our app

1. Schedule alarms for school or event
2. List of bookmarks for class links (GCalendar, GSheets)
3. Notifying timetable
4. Note-taking utility

If possible, attendance checking can be integrated to this app.

### 3. Risks 

The all-in-one has minor problems, being that some feature may not be available offline due to synchronization with online calendar and drive. The app may not be applicable to everyone as customization, such as for work or for personal use. (Future release)

### 4. Success Criteria
 
1. Weekly meeting on what have been done and what should be done next
2. Careful research and performing surveys
3. Committing to the project
