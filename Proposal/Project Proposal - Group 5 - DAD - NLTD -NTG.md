## Introduction
In the modern society, many people are working more than they should, resulting in very little time to relax, or to spend on personal hobbies. This can lead to people being tired or even worrse, stressed. 
It is necessary to tackle this common phenomenon, and for our project, we decided to make a game of chess, with the aim of getting people into a new hobby, and relieve their stresses.

## Objectives
+ To provide a chess game software with single player and local multiplayer.
+ Get people into playing chess as a new hobby.
+ Teach people the basic of how to play chess, and help them getting better as a chess player.

## Target customers
+ Kids who wants to learn chess.
+ Students who need a break from school works.
+ People working too much or stressed.
+ People who wants a new hobby.

## Features and Description
A simple, user-friendly UI with the following options:
+ Single player.
+ Multiplayer.
+ Puzzle.
+ How to play.
+ Match history.
+ Setting.
### Single player
The player will type their name and start a game with the machine. The match will be saved after finishing.

### Multiplayer
A local multiplayer where two players will play turn by turn. 

### Puzzle
The game provides some chess puzzle for players to solve.

### How to play
The game will provide basic knowledge of the chess game. This include how each chess piece moves, how to win the game, checkmate, stalemate definitions and so on.
