## Introduction
Name: Software Engineering Quest.
Type: A retro-styled pixel art action role-playing game.

  To create a compelling and unique role-playing experience for the players.
  
  **2. Plans**
 - Navigation: Move with w-a-s-d or Arrow keys.

 - Loot and leveling system: Earn levels to unlock new abilities.
 - An engaging story-line: 
 - Create a nostalgic experience similar to old retro role-playing games.

**3. Risks**

 - Undiscovered bugs, glitches and exploits due to limited play-testing.
 - Unpolished textures and sprite-work on account of limited time and resources.
 - Poor quality resulting from lack of experience making video games.
 - Limited coding skills.

Suitable for all ages.

**5. Similar project**
The game that we cloned: [https://aprilgame.itch.io/april-the-game](https://aprilgame.itch.io/april-the-game)
Reason: We decided to clone from this game since it has similar game-play and mechanics of which we envisioned for our existing project from first year.
