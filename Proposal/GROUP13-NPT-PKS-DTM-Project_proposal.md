## 1. Background

In this stressful soceity, many people are strained with work and deadlines. This attention we devote to our emails and our smartphones is considered a form of &quot;directed attention&quot; that our brains have only a finite amount of capacity for. When we overload we become irritable, error-prone, and stressed out. Gardening is a cure! Gardening is one of the most rewarding hobbies people can do, with long-lasting positive effects to themself, community, and to the world at large. A growing phenomenon across the world!

To catching up with that trend, we sought to provide and aid gardeners, whether hobby or proffessional to with their work.



## 2. Proposal
### 2.1 Vision and Goals

For beginners who grow plants, it is very important to find information on how to do as well as tips and advice but the information on the internet is very much and it is difficult to find the right information. The App will not only make the process of finding information easier but also a diary to help keep memories of your plants.

Then, our goals for making this app is

1. Ignite passion for planting tree
2. Support users with useful information, easy to reach
3. Create your own collection of gardening
4. Provide full data and nutrition charts
5. Give notification for sowing period and harvest time

### 2.3 Implications

Our mother earth is going through a very tough situation and we, the entire human race is very much responsible for this. We are destroying our environment consciously or unconsciously without even realizing its consequences. Now we have to act very smart and plan something to sustain what we still have. We have to think about our future generation as well, so that they get all necessary support from the nature to lead healthy lives.  To do so we need to use all natural amenities very smartly.

Gardening is always an excellent and environment friendly idea and if you can go for sustainable gardening then it will be even more useful for all.  Growing your own food is a good always helps. Gardening is a favorite hobby for many. It is the time to channelize your hobby towards a more meaningful motive. Even if you are a newbie you can start thinking about sustainable gardening. No matter how small your effort is, sustainable strategies have great impact. We are trying to green nowadays to protect our environment. There are many other small things which we can do contribute. You need not to make a lot of changes in your daily life if you go for gardening with sustainable measures. Slight effort from your side can do the trick.

But gardening is not an easy task and making a garden, not on the surface ground, is pretty much harder. In this case, everything should be done systemically. Again, there are lots of tasks like sowing, harvesting, identifying seeds, and plants, etc. that are quite complicated and you need some experience or helper for these tasks. Our app is great for those reasons.
