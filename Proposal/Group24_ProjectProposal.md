Overview 
The project I will be working on is to create a Web Scraper desktop application specifically designed to cater to the needs of stock investors. A web scraper, as the same suggests, is made to ‘scrape’ or collect information from websites and output the result into a .csv file. The main purpose of this project is to make a customizable assistant that can handle all of the repetitive labor tasks such as searching for info or choosing the suitable stocks, therefore save time for individual investors and help them make the right decision.

Objectives
•	Successfully scrape pre-assigned numerical and text info of any stock in any website
•	Output scraped info into .csv file
•	Featuring editable list of industries containing stocks ready to be scraped

Scope
The project will be divided into 2 parts:
•	User Interface
•	Web Scraper
