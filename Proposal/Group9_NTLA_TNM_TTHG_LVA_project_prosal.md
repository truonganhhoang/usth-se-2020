I.Purpose 
Everyday, we have to wake up on time to go to school-or work. Our busy life make it to be difficult for us 
to sleep enough- and then it is harder to wake up at the morning.
As students, we understand it clearly. Our group thinks about making an app that useful, easy to be applicability 
in daily life- then we thought about this problem, and decided to make an alarming app to solve it.

II.Detail

1.Language:
Java- app Android

2.Time in the app:
Time synchronization of the app with the world time zone.

3.Content:
About the idea, we have a list of things to do:

3.1. Alarm ringtone:
- There will be a list of default alarm ringtones in the app so that users can choose
- Moreover, usually it’s a little trouble to set ringtone by recording- we will try to make the app can do this directly.
- One more thing in this part is that we want to set the mode to automatically select random ringtones in a selected list. 
It will be one interesting thing for someone who does not want to hear one song every day but don’t need to set each alarm.

3.2. How to turn it off?
Sometimes we are too tired to wake up in normally way- for example, it’s me! After turning off an alarm, I usually fall asleep 
again because it does not “hard” for my brain. Then we think about these solutions:

-Number 1: Do mathmetics. It makes our brains have to work to find the answer of the question. If you fall asleep, then no way 
for you, the ringtones will turn on again and again. There will be some level for this: very easy, easy, medium, hard and very hard. 
At least there are 3 questions and you have to answer on time.

-Number 2: Shaking the phone. About the sensitivity when shaking the phone, it will stretch from light vibration to strong vibration
- which means users have to choose how to turn the alarm off: shake the phone gently or shake it frantically to turn off the bell
people have to do it on time also. And we can choose the number of times to shake the phone to turn alarm off.

-Number 3: Taking picture. Before sleeping, users use the app to take a picture- whatever you want that when you need to wake up, you 
need to take the picture exactly the same it. On time, also.

4.Countdown timer: Integrate this part into the app to improve the applicability.
