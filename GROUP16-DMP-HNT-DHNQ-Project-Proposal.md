## *1. Overview* 
### 1.1. Introduction: 
- Use: Help to calculate the amount of sleep and suggest ways to have the best sleep 
### 1.2. Background
- A big problem for students, undergraduate and employees is that you always feel so sleepy and tired even you slept 8-9 hours. It’s because you did not sleep the proper way. That’s why we want to develop an app to help increasing your sleep which can help you staying awake the next day.Getting enough 8 hours of sleep is good, but it is not an effective sleep. So we created an app that helps people calculate how to sleep properly. Based on knowledge of sleep: Our sleep often has many cycles, each cycle lasts 90 minutes and one cycle is divided into 5 stages: from the beginning of sleep to the time of deep sleep. So waking up at 4-5 stage will make you feel tired and vice versa if you wake up at the end of stage 5 and early stage 1, your body will be more alert and comfort.Getting enough 8 hours of sleep is good, but it is not an effective sleep.

## *3. Project details*
- When you first use the app, you will have to sign in by writing your name, age. , it will remind you about the importance of our sleep and help you to have an overview about the sleep.         - Next, you will have to list out your habits and your daily schedule. Based on that, our app will show you the time you should sleep. In case you are busy and need to shorten your sleep, you can just write down the time you start sleeping and our app will wake you up at the appropriate moment.
