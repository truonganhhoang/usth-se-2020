Introduction
In the Middle Ages, in order to get more information, as well as new events, the kings (or lords) would send people to spread the news orally. Then the era of steam came to the fore, thanks to steam technology, which led to the printing technology as well as traditional media publications such as newspapers, (and later magazines) ... Even when it entered the 1990s, newspapers were still an effective way of communicating to people, and one of the most effective propaganda weapons in the war.
Now that 4.0 technology is on the rise, the newspaper is still one of the most effective ways of communicating, but it's no longer able to retain its status. People increasingly towards convenience and can update quickly, daily, even for hours. And that is the birth of a new form: online newspapers
Online newspaper is not only text, images, but also audio, video and other interactive programs. Not limited by the framework, the number of pages, regardless of geographical distance, the online newspaper is capable of transmitting information worldwide with an unlimited number.
We update hot news about life, famous fashion events in the world, in addition we also have a weekly blog to guide necessary tips to make life easier.
