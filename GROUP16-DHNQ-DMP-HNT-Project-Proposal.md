### I. Introduction
- Use: Help to calculate the amount of sleep and suggest ways to have the best sleep 
- A big problem for students, undergraduate and employees is that you always feel so sleepy and tired even you slept 8-9 hours. 
  It’s because you did not sleep the proper way. That’s why we want to develop an app to help increasing your sleep which can help 
  you staying awake the next day.

### III. Project details
- When you first use the app, you will have to sign in by writing your name, age. One thing special about this app is that once 
  you sign in, it will remind you about the importance of our sleep and help you to have an overview about the sleep.         
- Next, you will have to list out your habits and your daily schedule. Based on that, our app will show you the time you should 
  sleep. In case you are busy and need to shorten your sleep, you can just write down the time you start sleeping and our app will
  wake you up at the appropriate moment.
