## *1. Overview*

### 1.1. Introduction:
  
- Name: Savable (Save able)
- Type: Application
- Purpose: Help to save money and create plan to accomplish the set goals. It's the combination of to do list and financial spending.

### 1.2. Background:
   
   > How many plans do you have and still remember?
   
  People are hard to manage and save up enough money for their dreams, they usually spend over their budget because of many attractive items while you're surfing the web, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
  These day, it is hard to remember and focus to what you have wish to done. It's also hard to keep track of how far you have done or what you need to prepare. So this app will help you to list what you want to do before some events of your life, to predict how much money you need to complete it and remind what you need to prepare.
   
## *2. Goals*
We want to help the user in: 
- List wishes
- Have reasonable spending plan
- Be able to organize your own plans
- Check the progress of completion
- Our tips work successful
- Motivation to help achieve dreams

## *3. Highlight*
It's the combination between List-to-do and financial spending. After some update, we will create a minigame to stimulate the desire to accomplish the set goals. Also, we will help to user to assess the importance of setting goals so they have to consider what to finish first. 

When the user achieve goal, they wil get the points to race with the other. The reward will be add to upgrade things in minigame.

The minigame can be like have your own pet or simply a garden. The game will have some points use for grow pet or raise tree, buy background, buy more pets or buy decoration. The game will not take the user's time and bring peaceful atmosphere because we don't want to user to be too focus on the game and they need time to relax and free the mind.
