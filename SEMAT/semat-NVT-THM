Stakeholders are the people or organization who are in need of a software system. 
They identify the opportunity and demand the requirements to complete the software system.
The stakeholder is a source of fund, providing support for the team, to ensure the required software system is produced.
That opportunity is the condition for the development and expansion of such software system,
The opportunity assert the purpose of creating a new software system or modification of the system.

Requirements are the needs of a software system to satisfy the opportunities and stakeholders.
The requirements are discussed and perceived by the stakeholders and the team, which are brought into the development and testing of the project.
The software system consists of software, hardware and data implementation to fulfil such requirements. 
Created from engineering primary contributes to great scale.

Work is the effort and contribution of the team to meet the requirements of a software system production. 
The scope and constraints are defined through requirements, presented by the stakeholders.
During the work period, updates are proposed to change and modify the software system. A team is, therefore, initiated to plan and execute the work, producing the software system.
Teams are actively engaged in development, deployment and maintenance of the project.
The ways of working is developed through the progression of projects. Teams apply this way of working to progress faster.
