A stakeholder is a core factor among concerned components in SEMAT diagram, since its role 
has a great effect on other activities. They are what gives rise to the coming in existence 
of a software system. The stakeholder determines their reasons and purposes on using that 
software so that they will put forward the demands for requirements. Therefore, any software 
needs consumers and users with the view to helping to address the stakeholders’ opportunity 
and fulfilling their requirements at the same time. As depicted in the diagram, opportunity 
and stakeholder are considered as customer. A solid team is indispensable when it comes to 
building a software system. The workload and the team are generally called endeavor. The team, 
with full support of the stakeholder, is able to perform, come up with a plan, and also apply 
their ways of working, which guides them to the work needed. This means that their work must 
meet the requirements that have been scoped with the aim of succeeding in being set up to 
address the opportunity. Within the process of creating the software, work adaption is 
required to make updates and changes on the software system. In the end, requirements and a 
software system is the key, the solution to the whole work to satisfy demands of the 
stakeholder.
