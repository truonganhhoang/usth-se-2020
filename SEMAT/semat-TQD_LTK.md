The picture shows the relationship between different factors of software engineering.There are three parts, each with different factors. 

The first part is about CUSTOMER, with two factors, which are Opportunity and Stakeholders. In this part, Stakeholders, who use and consume or sell the Software System, will identify Opportunity, support the Team and demand them some Requirements. And Opportunity will focus on fulfilling Requirements.

The second part is about SOLUTION, with the Software System and the Requirements. Firstly, the Software System, is produced by the Team to fulfill some Requirements, which helps to address Opportunity. Secondly, the Requirements will have some Scopes and Constraints to the Work of the Team.

The third part is about ENDEAVOR, consists of Work, Team and Way of Working. To begin with, the Team, who produces the Software System and supported by the Stakeholders, will apply Way of Working in order to plan and perform Work. On the other hand,  Work, which is guided by Way of Working, will then go back to update and change the Software System to address the Opportunity.

In conclusion, ENDEAVOR is set up to become a SOLUTION for the CUSTOMER.The relationship of customers and purpose of product is stable ,therefore company or stakeholder always to try to find demand what customer need for application
