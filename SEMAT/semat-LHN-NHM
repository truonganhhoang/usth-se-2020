+Thare are 3 different parts in this picture, with their own facotr.

+The initial segment is about customer, with two components, which are oppotunity and skateholders. In this part, skateholders, who utilize and devour or sell the Software System, will distinguish oppoturnity, bolster the Team and request them a few requirements. Also, oppoturnity will concentrate on satisfying requirements.
+
+ The subsequent part is about solution, with the software system and the requirements. Right off the bat, the software system, is created by the team to satisfy a few requirements, which tends to opportunity. Furthermore, the requirements will have a few scopes and constraints to the work of the team.
+
+The third part is about endeavor, comprises of work, team and way of working. In any case, the team, who creates the software system and bolstered by the stakeholders, will apply way of working so as to design and perform work. Then again, work, which is guided by way of working, will at that point return to refresh and change the software system to address the opportunity.
