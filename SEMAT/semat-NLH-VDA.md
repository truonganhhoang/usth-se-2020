	Designing a new system or software must root back to the need of customers, which is why “customers” are put on top of any other element. It is fundamental that the software provide some value to the customers or bring some benefit to customers, for example: alleviate an existing problem or lessen the current amount of work.
	
	Stakeholders are individuals, organizations or groups that are concerned about the development and application of the system. The stakeholders need to outline the requirements for the software in order to provide a guideline for software engineers. They only need to demonstrate the function and not specify the methods behind that. Changing requirements are one of the biggest challenges software teams encounter.
	
	From the project's requirements, engineers can derive a solution, or a protocol to solve customers' problems. A qualified software must meet these criteria:
	1. Functionality – Must serve some function.
	2. Quality – Reliability, Performance, Rich user experience, etc.
	3. Extensibility – From version to version and platform to platform.

	The last step in software engineering is actually building the system. This process is called the endeavor - an attempt to achieve creation of the product software. It is evident that this task cannot be completed without the co-operation of a team. The team needs be comprised of members with different sets of skills and experience. They should be able to improvise, adapt and overcome different kinds of drawbacks. Team-working skill is also crucial: team work makes dream work.
	
	Work should be put under constraint of time and Eeffort.Time is limited by deadline. Effort is limited by human strength and knowledge. The idea is to get things done fast but with high quality. Team members should make a common agreement about tools and the process.
