The overall terms in SEMAT can be summarized into three parts: Customer,Solution and Endeavor. 
Customer: The value of software in reality
Solution: What is the software likes
Endeavor: How to develop the software
In Customer: we have Stakeholders: the target of the software: those who uses the software either by themselves or to sell them to others.
They see the Opportunity: the problems - what Software System aimed to address and solve.
The Software System (result of Endeavor) that is created must fulfils its Requirements - which exist due to the demand of the Stakeholders and are the focuses of the Opportunity - the problem-solving itself, Stakeholders can change their Requirements over time. These Requirements put scope and restraints to the real action: Work - the real action put the Opportunity into a product.
Work (in Endeavor) impacts directly the Software System and must have a Team to do it. In producing Software System, those Teams apply their Way of Working - can be seen as an agreement between members on how the Work will be done. The Team should be assisted in some way by the Stakeholders.
