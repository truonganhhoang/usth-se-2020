The overall terms in SEMAT can be summarized into three parts: Customer,Solution and Endeavor.

(Customer: The value of software in reality
Solution: What is the software likes
Endeavor: How to develop the software)
In real life,problem needs solving always exists and therefore: exists the Opportunity to solve it and the Stakeholder - The people who directly or indirectly in a way use the Software developed by the Opportunity and have interest in developing and using them in a way. Those Stakeholders,who cares about the Software,of course hold what the Software is like,or in other words,the Requirements of how the software should be. Those Requirements affects how the system should aim to do and fulfil,but not directly propose the characteristics of the software itself. The Software System,being concerned by the Stakeholder,of course must align with those Requirements.  The act of developing the Software System itself is called Work, which aim is to solving the problem that needs to be deal with, or in other words the Oppoturnity that gives birth to the software system. In developing those software system,a Team, with quality members and having good teamwork are needed to deal with the Work as effecient as possible. As a team always needs agreement and a common vision and tactics in order for the development of the software to succeed, a Way of Working in a Team is always prevalent.
