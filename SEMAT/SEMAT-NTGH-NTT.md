The SEMAT picture shows us how a software engineer works. 
First the engineer can work as an individual or do the project as a team. 
The team then performs an plans the software systems. 
The stakeholder then use the software system and then support the team by telling them if their software needed any updates or changes. If the software fulfills the requirements then the stakeholder the n identifies some opportunities for the engineer that focuses the requirements.
To sum up, the team of software engineers have their idea develop it then the stakeholder use it and if its got all the requirements then the stakeholder will give the team an business opportunity.
