The given picture describes how the Kernel process. This is a universal term that involves in every software development project. The most important things in Kernel are alphas, which is divided in three sections: Customer, Solution and Endeavor. These things progress independently, they represent different dimensions of software development and each alpha has progression states. 

Firstly, in Customer section there are Opportunity and Stakeholder alphas. Stakeholders are the customers who want to use and consume the developed software of developing one. Opportunity provide value to customers to complete the software. 

Secondly, in Solution section there are Requirements and Software System alphas. The customers see an opportunity which is implemented in a software system. The Software System helps to address the opportunity and fulfils requirements. Stakeholders demands Requirements of what the Software can do but not explicitly express how it must do it. 

Thirdly, in Endeavor section there are Work, Team, Way of Working alphas. The primary outcome of a software endeavor is the Software System. The Work’s results will update and change to the Software System while the Team is what directly produces the Software System. Developers have Work to do to fulfils Requirements and through Requirements the Team can scopes and constrains Work. There always a Team to develop the software and a Way of Working the project. The Team applies the Way of Working while the Way of Working guides the work. Stakeholders supports the Team so them can Work the project to set up to address Opportunity.
