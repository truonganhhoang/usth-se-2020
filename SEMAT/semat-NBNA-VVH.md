The kernel contains seven key elements - Requirements, Software System, Team, Work, Way of Working, Opportunity and Stakeholders.

The stakeholders provide the opportunity and are the source of the requirements and funding for the software system. The opportunity create the reason for the creation of the new software. It represents the team's  understanding of the stakeholders needs and helps shape the requirements for the software system by providing justification.
Requirements are important to discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the development and testing of the system.A system made up of software, hardware, and data that provides its primary value by the execution of the software.In the context of software engineering, work is everything that the team does to get the goals of producing a software system matching the requirements and addressing the opportunity by the stakeholders.The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current context.
