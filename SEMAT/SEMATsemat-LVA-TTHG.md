SEMAT is short for Software Engineering Method and Theory, an initiative meant to connect the developer and the academic community.

There are 3 sections for engineering programs: endeavour, solution and customer.
Below is the procedure:

Stakeholder identifies opportunities, therefore they find a team to support. The team sets out to produce 
the software system. The stakeholders will then test the software system and demand the requirements.
After that, the team has to address the opportunity, focusing on the requirements. The requirements hould
include the scope and constraints for the work of the team. The work would then be updated and changed
accordingly. The software must fulfill the requirements. 
The stakeholder uses and confirmes the software system, continues with the 
requirements. The team, corresponding to the stakeholder's requirements, will work again to 
address the opportunity. The opportunity completes the requirements.
