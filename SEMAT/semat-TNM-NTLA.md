	The first area is customer. They are people who buy product. The opportunity is a chance to provide product (develop new software, fix bugs,..) 
	to customer that project team can make money from it. They provide requirements and the project team will create product based on those requirements.
	The stakeholders can be individual, organization or groups that interest/concern about the project, they are affectted by the project. They identifies 
	opportunity, uses and consumes the product, demand the requirements and support the project team.
	
	The second part is solution or the product that made to satisfy customer's requirements. Requirements are the things that customer needed or wanted.
	From those requirements, project team know their working scope and challenges, to create a product that fulfills customer's requirements.
		
	The last part is endeavor - actions to achieve a goal. Actually it's project team and their working. Team members need to work hard, carefully 
	to create, update and change products. They need to have the same goal (to not affect project). They should create a clear plan, follow it and working 
	rules.
	
	Inconclusion, this graph is a circle that each element will affect on the others and vice versa.
