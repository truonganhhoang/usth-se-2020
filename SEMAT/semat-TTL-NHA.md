•	Customer – This area of concern contains everything to do with the actual use and exploitation of the software system to be produced. The area of concern and its card are colored green.									
•	Solution – This area of concern contains everything to do the specification and development of the software system. This area of concern and its cards are colored yellow.
•	Endeavor – This area of concern contains everything to do with the team, and the way that they approach their work. This area of concern is colored blue.
In the customer area of concern the team needs to understand the stakeholders and the opportunity to be addressed:
1.	Stakeholders: The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system.
The stakeholders provide the opportunity and are the source of the requirements and funding for the software system. The team members are also stakeholders.  The stakeholders should be involved throughout the software engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable software system is produced.
2.	Opportunity: The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system.
The opportunity articulates the reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It represents the team's shared understanding of the stakeholders' needs, and helps shape the requirements for the new software system by providing justification for its development.
In the solution area of concern the team needs to establish a shared understanding of the requirements, and implement, build, test, deploy and support a software system that fulfills them:
Requirements: What the software system must do to address the opportunity and satisfy the stakeholders.
It is important to discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the development and testing of the new system.
4.	Software System: A system made up of software, hardware, and data that provides its primary value by the execution of the software.
The primary product of any software engineering endeavor, a software system can be part of a larger software, hardware or business solution.
In the endeavor area of concern the team and its way-of-working have to be formed, and the work has to be done:
5.	Work: Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a result.
In the context of software engineering, work is everything that the team does to meet the goals of producing a software system matching the requirements, and addressing the opportunity, presented by the stakeholders. The work is guided by the practices that make up the team's way-of-working.
6.	Team: A group of people actively engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery or support of a specific software system.
One or more teams plan and perform the work needed to create, update and/or change the software system.
7.	Way-of-Working: The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work.
The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current context.
